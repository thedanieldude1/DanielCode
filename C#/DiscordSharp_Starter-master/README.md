# DiscordSharp_Starter
### Introduction
So YOU want to make a discord bot of your own? Look no further! This is exactly what you need! DiscordSharp_Starter is a starter project to get you started at making your very own Discord bot using DiscordSharp! I myself am currently using the latest version of discordsharp for this project, but you can actually use any version you'd like! *(you might have to change some stuff due to library changes.)* 

### DiscordSharp
I hear you asking, what exactly is DiscordSharp? DiscordSharp is an AMAZING discord bot library made by LuigiFan. You can download it [here](https://github.com/Luigifan/DiscordSharp). It's fairly easy to use and a good way to get you into bot development!

### My Discord server
And on top of all of that, If you need any help i would love to help you out! just join me at my personal [discord server!](https://discord.gg/0oZpaYcAjfvkDuE4) and ask anything you'd like! But please, DON'T add any bots without my permission. it's kinda rude :)

### Functions
And i hear you asking, what does this starter bot do? Well, I already predicted you wouyd ask that! so i made a nice list of functions :)

- [x] Check if a channel message has been received, and respond to that
- [x] Check if a private message has been received, and respond to that
- [x] Join a channel after receiving a "join *inviteurl*" private message
